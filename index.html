    <h4>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming language, the first public build was released on May 17, 2009. The game continued development for two years, leading to its full release on November 18, 2011. Persson then left Mojang, passing development control to Jens "Jeb" Bergensten. In 2014, Mojang and Minecraft were purchased by Microsoft for $2.5 billion. Today, Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly players as of 2024.</h4>
    
    <h4>In Minecraft, players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world made of voxels. They can mine resources, craft tools, and build structures. There are two main game modes: survival mode, where players must gather resources to survive, and creative mode, offering unlimited resources and the ability to fly. Minecraft's large community offers user-generated content like mods, servers, skins, and custom maps that expand the game's possibilities.</h4>

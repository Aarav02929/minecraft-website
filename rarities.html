    <h1>Rarities in Minecraft</h1>
    <p>In Minecraft, items are categorized based on their rarity. Some items are extremely hard to find, while others are quite common. Below is an explanation of some key items in Minecraft and their relative rarities.</p>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>1. Dragon Egg - Rarest</h2>
        <p>The Dragon Egg is considered the rarest item in Minecraft. It spawns only once when the Ender Dragon is defeated in the End dimension. Since there's only one per world (without respawning the dragon), it holds the title of the rarest item.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>2. Beacon</h2>
        <p>The Beacon is another rare item in Minecraft. Although it can be crafted, obtaining the Nether Star, which is required for crafting a Beacon, is quite difficult as it requires defeating the Wither.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>3. Elytra</h2>
        <p>The Elytra is a rare item found in End Ships within End Cities. It is one of the few ways to fly in the game, making it highly valuable and rare.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>4. Netherite</h2>
        <p>Netherite is a rare material that is used to upgrade diamond gear. It is found in the Nether by mining ancient debris, which is scattered sparingly across the dimension.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>5. Enchanted Golden Apple</h2>
        <p>The Enchanted Golden Apple, often called "Notch Apple," is an extremely rare food item that can only be found in loot chests in certain structures like dungeons and temples.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>6. Diamonds</h2>
        <p>Diamonds are considered rare but are more common than the items above. They are found deep underground and are essential for crafting strong tools and armor.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>7. Iron Ingot - Least Rare</h2>
        <p>Iron is one of the most abundant resources in Minecraft. It is found in large quantities underground and is crucial for crafting tools, weapons, and armor early in the game.</p>
    </div>
<hr>
<footer>
    <p>Overall, the Dragon Egg is the rarest item, while Iron Ingots are the least rare among valuable resources.</p>
